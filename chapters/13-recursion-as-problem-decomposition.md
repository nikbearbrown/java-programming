# Module 11: Recursion as Problem Decomposition

**One-line:** Students specify recursive methods as decomposition contracts and audit AI-generated recursion for the three failure modes specification silence produces.

## Learning Objectives

- M11-LO1 [PF] (Apply) Specify a recursive method: base case with termination condition, recursive case with reduction step, termination invariant.
- M11-LO2 [PA] (Analyze) Given AI-generated recursive implementations, identify: missing base case, incorrect reduction step, stack overflow conditions.
- M11-LO3 [IJ] (Evaluate) Decide between recursive and iterative implementation using stack depth, readability tradeoff, and maximum safe input size.

## Opening Case

AI writes a recursive method to count files in nested folders. It works on the demo directory. Then it receives a deeply nested archive and the JVM stack overflows. The specification never named maximum depth, cycle behavior, or the condition under which recursion should stop.

The mistake is tempting because the code looks like progress. That is the recurring trap in this course. AI can produce an artifact faster than the learner can fully explain the artifact's obligations. The course therefore asks the learner to slow down at the handoff, not at the keyboard.

## Core Concept

Recursion is not a trick where a method calls itself. It is a decomposition contract: solve the smallest case directly, reduce every larger case toward that smallest case, and preserve a termination invariant. AI can imitate recursive shapes. The conductor must verify that the shape actually shrinks the problem.

A recursive specification has three required parts: base case, recursive case, and termination invariant. It should also name maximum safe input size or explain why stack depth is acceptable.

This is where the AI-era Java course differs from a coverage-first Java course. The chapter still teaches real Java. It just teaches Java as a language for constraining and auditing delegated work. Dilnoza does not need to become faster than AI at producing boilerplate. She needs to become precise enough that the boilerplate can be judged.

## Worked Example

**Situation.** For `countFiles(File root)`, the base case is a plain file returning one. The recursive case is a directory returning the sum of child counts. The termination invariant is that each recursive call moves to a strict child path and never revisits a path. The handoff condition fails if AI omits empty-directory behavior or follows symbolic links without cycle protection.

**Analytical process.** The conductor does four things before accepting the output:

1. Names the intended behavior in a sentence short enough to be falsified.
2. Identifies the Java element that carries the promise: class, method, interface, event handler, data structure, or graph edge.
3. Writes a handoff condition that can pass or fail.
4. Records the human audit task in the Boondoggle Score before moving downstream.

| Recursion as Problem Decomposition Boondoggle Score excerpt with columns for AI task, human supervisory capacity, handoff condition, evidence, and downstream dependency. | A concrete checkpoint for applying the chapter concept. |

**Dead end.** The common dead end is accepting the first artifact that appears coherent. Coherence is not compliance. The learner must point to the exact clause or invariant the artifact satisfies.

**Resolution.** The output is accepted only after the handoff condition passes. If the condition fails, the student does not patch silently. She revises the prompt, records the failure, and explains whether the failure came from the prompt, the model output, or the human's missing constraint.

**The lesson:** generated Java is a candidate answer, not evidence of completion.

**The limit:** this method cannot prove every property of a system; it makes the most important obligations explicit enough to audit.

## Boondoggle Score Checkpoint

For this module, add one score segment with these fields:

- **AI task:** the work the model is allowed to perform for recursion as problem decomposition.
- **Human task:** the decision or audit the learner must perform personally.
- **Handoff condition:** one binary rule that must pass before the next dependency begins.
- **Evidence:** the exact code, prompt clause, diagram edge, or revision note that proves the handoff passed.
- **Supervisory capacity:** one of Problem Formulation, Tool Orchestration, Plausibility Auditing, Interpretive Judgment, or Executive Integration.

The checkpoint is intentionally small. The course is building a habit: every delegation has an acceptance condition, and every acceptance condition has evidence.

## Common Misconceptions

**If there is a base case, recursion is safe.** The recursive case must move toward that base case. A base case unreachable from some inputs is decoration.

**Recursive code is always more elegant.** Elegance does not pay for stack overflow. Maximum input size matters.

**AI is good at recursion patterns, so this is low risk.** Pattern fluency can hide a wrong reduction step.

## Exercises

1. **Apply:** Write a prompt for a Java artifact in this module's domain. Include output format, constraints, and at least two things AI must not do.
2. **Analyze:** Given an AI-generated answer, mark the first line or design choice that violates the specification. Explain whether the problem is prompt omission, model failure, or human acceptance failure.
3. **Create:** Add one Boondoggle Score row for your own course project. The row must include AI task, human task, handoff condition, and evidence.
4. **Evaluate:** Name one alternative design or prompt choice and defend why you rejected it. Your defense must name the failure mode the alternative would introduce.

## What Would Change My Mind

I would revise this chapter's central claim if controlled classroom evidence showed that students who accepted AI-generated Java with only code-output grading developed equal or better ability to identify specification violations, defend architectural decisions, and catch hidden failure states than students who maintained Boondoggle Scores. The relevant evidence would need to test transfer to unfamiliar systems, not just performance on the same assignment type.

## Still Puzzling

- How much Java syntax should be retrieved from memory before AI assistance becomes educationally harmful rather than helpful?
- Which handoff conditions are best checked by inspection, and which require execution, tests, or peer review?
- How should the course calibrate students who arrive with strong Java experience but weak specification discipline?
- What evidence from the first course run should be added to replace illustrative cases with documented local cases?

Claims about specific AI-tool performance, wage premiums, or current platform behavior should be verified near publication. The TIKTOC's 56% wage-premium claim is motivational but still needs original-source confirmation before final release. [verify]
